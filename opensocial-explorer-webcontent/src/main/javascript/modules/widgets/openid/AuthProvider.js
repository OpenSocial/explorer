               * Most of Shindig's oauthpopup is generic enough that it could be reused for an
               * openId popup. The only thing that would change would be the "destination"
               * parameter that is provided to the gadgets.oauth.Popup constructor. This
               * destination, in the case of OAuth, has a redirect URI that points to the
               * Shindig server on it. We would need something similar for OpenID so that the
               * server could receive the response from the OpenID request and mint a security
               * token with the owner and viewer ID in it. This is the only way to secure the
               * process. We can't allow clients to mint security tokens or a hosted version of
               * OSE would be inherently insecure.
               * 
               * The real issue is how does the client get the security token securely? In the
               * case of OAuth, this is done with a security token. I think we may not be able
               * to get around the fact that we need a server-side processed page that writes
               * the security token into it -OR- part of the redirect that occurs with the
               * OpenID popup could allow us to pass the variable to the main client page before
               * the popup window closes.
